/**
 * 6. Didn’t you always hate it that you had to deal with checked exceptions in a
 * Runnable? Write a method uncheck that catches all checked exceptions and turns
 * them into unchecked exceptions. For example,
 * new Thread(uncheck(
 * () -> { System.out.println("Zzz"); Thread.sleep(1000); })).start();
 * // Look, no catch (InterruptedException)!
 * Hint: Define an interface RunnableEx whose run method may throw any exceptions.
 * Then implement public static Runnable uncheck(RunnableEx runner). Use a
 * lambda expression inside the uncheck function.
 * Why can’t you just use Callable<Void> instead of RunnableEx?
